# GCalFlic
Simplistic time tracking that adds entries to a Google Calendar by triggering a Flic button action to run go binaries. 

I wanted a way to log my time; leaving home, start work, stop work, arriving home. Quantifiable data for me to evaluate when and how I'm working and react as appropriate for my family.
